# Awesome City ... change the world

... With fresh thinking powered by AI.<br />

Awesome City is part of an ecosystem to deliver Artificial General Intelligence in a safe, humane, productive way to all - it is a developmental resource.<br />We have a value system that's based on exploitation and greed, it has only led to various blots in history and todays climate change. How about something radical that's driven by AI and based on dignity, wellbeing and innovation instead?

![Awesome City home ownership](Images/homeAndInfrastructureOwnership.png?raw=true)

<br />Awesome City is an open source concept for an ideal, sustainable, self-organising community based on the built in trust of the blockchain, and which finances itself by harnessing AI to identify and build businesses around its talented people. It re-invents the city as an integrated, modular machine for generating wellbeing underlined by AI<br />This repo  is based on the [LushCoin white paper](https://github.com/Grand-Axe/LushCoin/raw/master/Docs/LushCoinWhitePaper.pdf) as well as being a living addendum to it - **read the LushCoin white paper if you haven't done so yet**. This repo will serve as a tool for consensus on AI governance, it will also be a directory of foundational projects, costing/analysis, papers and academic collaboration.

Awesome City's knowledge base will be organised as an ontology based on the [meaning grid](https://github.com/Grand-Axe/Okeuvo-Lite/), with each item indexed by its OkeuvoLite hash.

### Sustainable profit

The LushCoin method measures profit as consisting of several components; primarily impact on wellbeing and dignity; then areas like available skills, research base, regional literacy levels, and finally monetary profit - a holistic graph of every aspect of life that will be impacted by the innovation to be funded.

Compare that to a firm that makes billions in "profit", but whose activities lead to illness and climate change that blights millions. It cannot be said to be truly profitable in any moral or logical sense, except in a predatory model.<br />Sadly, this same predatory model not only limits achievable profit, but drives other predatory impulses like privacy theft and "profit", even if it results in abuses of human dignity such as propagating sweat shops.
Further, current systems see the employed as part of business costs, rather than viewing the number of people a business can attract to work for it in an open source way as part of its profit.

How about a system that promotes dignity, wellbeing and knowledge growth through open source, yet has the potential to generate far more revenues than any system in existence today?

That's what Awesome City is.

This topic is of vital importance now, because traditional human jobs will shrink as machines become more mainstream. The binary choice is between a future of undignified mass unemployment or rewarding new forms of work in a retuned value system that places the creativity of the human mind as its fungible property. This contrasts with current systems, which are stretched to breaking point by the pace of technological innovation because they are based on things that can be manipulated, such as gold or consumer confidence (this is in turn increasingly influenced by click baiting "outrages", fake news campaigns and other similarly nebulous artifices).  

### Pick and choose

It a concept for grassroots organisation that can help to alleviate the growth burden of modern society, particularly in countries that have not yet developed basic infrastructure. LushCoin communities can take the parts that fit to their needs and locales, with one exception; **adherence to the AI ethical framework - [The Creed](https://github.com/Grand-Axe/The-Creed) is compulsory.**

> ### What's LushCoin?
>
> LushCoin is a concept for a publicly owned, open source cryptocurrency that depends on a novel AI method, [OkeuvoLite](https://github.com/Grand-Axe/Okeuvo-Lite)  to first create a unique hash for any idea (regardless of what that idea might be or how its text is expressed) and then generate tokens equivalent to the value of the idea for its funding.
>
> The generated hash can be used to determine the originality of a concept and to evaluate its potential contribution to human wellbeing and dignity. This gets done through a consensus system based on novel open source and crowd consensus methods (see the [LushCoin white paper)](https://github.com/Grand-Axe/LushCoin/raw/master/Docs/LushCoinWhitePaper.pdf). <br />Funds will be generated to finance viable original concepts and inventions, taking local feelings and gaps in resources into account.
>
> Currently, an astonishing 97% of patent applications fail - not because they are no good, but because they fail to meet a flawed definition of profit that only takes material gain into account, to the neglect of all other forms of gain. <br />For example; where patents in many areas of climate change and open source will fail for lack of profitability (in the narrow sense of the market definition), a LushCoin project would consider impacts on wellbeing, human dignity, knowledge increase and dissemination ... as well as its ability to generate material gain. <br />For emphasis, despite its obvious benefits to humanity, a breakthrough open source invention of an Antarctic based climate saving device to harmlessly rid the atmosphere off excess carbon dioxide will almost certainly fail in todays material profit only market; whereas it will pass muster in LushCoin - no strings attached.<br />The very same wasteful ethos that see's 97% of patents failing also drives climate change and other lopsided effects.

The burgeoning bureaucracies of modern day systems cannot react fast enough to both the rapid pace of technology and the increasing urgency of climate change demands - particularly at the grassroots level where laser like decisiveness and almost acrobatic levels of reaction are required.<br />Current short term stop gaps do not make things any easier for citizens of the gamut of increasingly disorganised society (from Arctic to Antarctica).

### Society as a graph

In order to unroll just compensation for each individuals personal circumstances, graph methods (utilising [OkeuvoLite](https://github.com/Grand-Axe/Okeuvo-Lite) to create a universally unique hash for any concept) will be used to identify gaps and evaluate how various factors contribute to societal growth and wellbeing. <br />Everyone from the innovator to the end user is a node in the the graph resulting in a self reinforcing loop of greater wellbeing generating greater incentive to innovate. The community is always in the loop and thoroughly informed; it evaluates the idea then, if it has value and passes safety requirements, tests it. Here's a pictorial overview;

![Invent-innovate cycle](Images/cycle.png?raw=true)

The strength of this approach will be showcased in areas where skills and opportunity are currently thrown away; for example, strongly identifying women as needing compensation (through weightings, invention and innovation) for their heavy contributions to societal growth and capacity (through childbirth, nurturing and work gaps, as well as having to undergo consequential bodily and mental changes).<br />Women are just one example; compensating for similar factors in all affected areas would not only increase the talent pool with those who have been shut out, but will also create its own rich ecosystem of invention and innovation - a win-win.

Awesome City can create money and opportunity from areas that todays economics treats as black holes.

### Rights

The following fundamental rights will be upheld:

1. [dignity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignity);
2. privacy;
3. transactions via a medium of trust - the blockchain;
4. access to knowledge;
5. just reward for innovation;
6. a home;
7. a basic wage;
8. water and energy self-sufficiency;
9. a liveable climate for all generations;
10. the right have discussions on the direction AI takes;
11. the right to a binding vote on the direction of AI.

### Renewables and materials

Sustainable methods would be used to both drive up energy efficiency and for construction wherever possible, here are some examples:

1. the weight of cities is currently wasted, it will be used as an energy store by clever use of such means as floatation, use of metamaterials, Non-Newtonian fluids, harnessing the weights of car parks, the altitude of a city might rise and fall with the tides to create potential etc.;
2. weights of parts of a home can be used to power water and air filtration systems for domestic use, for instance the weight of a column of pumped water can help with its filtration;
3. fast growing organic structural materials like bamboo will replace steel for climate saving;
4. extensive use will be made of fibres from fast growing carbon sinks like the "nuisance" water hyacinth;
5. high volume extrusion and moulding methods will be preferred for construction, the cost of building will be lowered by utilising recycled materials and alternative composites to extrude whole wall and other house sections, roads and pavements (sidewalks) - complete with piping and wiring for services;
6. each house will come as a package, with a prefabricated, strongly standardised section of street and sidewalk that belong to the house owner; as well as generating infrastructure as required, this will increase the volume from which a building can share lighting, harvest energy (solar, scavenged etc.) and obtain rents;
7. services, such as electricity, water and sewage (the extent will vary with locality) will be decentralised - renewable energy, septic tanks and soakaway pits being emphasised.
8. each building will be self-sufficient in energy;
9. fast growing carbon sinks such as certain types of algae will be used in cleaning, nutrition, farming and energy cycles;

### Modularity and infrastructure ownership

Infrastructure such as roads, wiring, drainage etc. will be standardised. They will also be owned by the dwellers and be modular to assist both this, upgrade and manufacturing ease. Each building will come with a section a section of road and pavement. In this way, infrastructure will organically extend with each new building.

### They talk right, but zig and zag? ... Sack them

Ownership of the city's infrastructure will make its dwellers very vested in its wellbeing,  renting out  infrastructure will give them the ability to sack erring tenants e.g. climate violators, privacy guzzlers or Shylock utilities.

That's liberty.

### Privacy

Infrastructure ownership will give individuals and communities better control to the access points of their privacy and dignity. It isn't taught in schools but, humankind is the only creature with a developed sense of privacy.<br />Therefore, the invasion (or legalised theft) of privacy not only makes them do unpaid work against their will (slavery); but most importantly, reduces a persons humanity and moves them closer to the rank of animals, thus providing for a recursive cycle of ever intensifying weakening of human dignity and priviledge.

'Ever heard of the private life of an antelope?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery

### Revenue generation

Awesome City will generate revenue for its upkeep and locale dependent arrangements by harnessing its intellectual property, citizen ownership of infrastructure and by its network services.<br />It will be heavily networked giving the possibility of bolting on various services for hire. Each service being modular and upgradable. An example of a bolt on service might be having sensors in each building, so that an entire country or even a continent could double as a giant radio telescope.
