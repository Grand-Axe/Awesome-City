Awesome City is a sustainable, self-running city on the blockchain in which everyone can own a house and house owners in turn, own the infrastructure of the city.

Ownership of the city's infrastructure will make its dwellers very vested in its wellbeing and give them the ability to sack erring or Shylock utilities who must rent infrastructure from them.

Infrastructure ownership also gives individuals and communities better control to the access points of their privacy. Humankind is the only creature with a developed sense of privacy, so invasion of privacy reduces a persons humanity and moves them closer to the rank of animals.

In general, the way Awesome City works is by:
1. lowering the cost of building by utilising plastic waste and alternative composites to extrude whole wall and other house sections, roads and pavements (sidewalks) complete with piping and wiring for services;
2. each house coming as a package with a prefabricated section of street and sidewalk that belongs to the house owner;
3. decentralisation of services, such as electricity, water and sewage (the extent will vary with locality).

It is expected that Awesome City will spur several inventions and innovations, from construction methods to legal frameworks.
