# Windway

Windway is a transportation system based on generating pressure differences in a long tube such that winds blow through it. The main method is by employing a heat pipe to conduct heat from one end of a tube to the other to set up a chimney effect.

Windway is expected to generate opportunities for talented people to invent various sail crafts, ground effect machines, other services (postal for instance) and varied automations and so forth that can utilise Windway.
